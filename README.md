# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

I built this project as a way to help students learning about data structures and algorithms fully conceptualize how Dijkstra's Algorithm works. The app features a fully-functional graph designer tool and algorithm animation that displays the state of both the graph and priority queue after each step in the traversal.
